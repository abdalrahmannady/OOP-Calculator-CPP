🧮 Simple OOP Calculator (My First OOP Project)
Welcome to my first ever Object-Oriented Programming project! 🚀

I built this simple yet robust calculator using C++ to practice the core principles of OOP, specifically focusing on how to manage state and data within a class.

🌟 Features
Arithmetic Operations: Full support for Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.

State Management: A Clear function to reset the calculator to its initial state.

Internal Logic: Uses an Enum to track the last operation performed for accurate reporting.

Safety First: Includes a built-in check for Division by Zero to prevent program crashes.

🛠️ Concepts Applied
Encapsulation: All sensitive data like _Result and _LastNumber are private, ensuring data integrity.

Enums: Used for clean and readable operation tracking.

Abstraction: The user interacts with simple methods while the complex logic happens behind the scenes.
📋 Example Output
Result after Adding 100 is : 100
Result after Subtracting 20 is : 80
Result after Multiplying 2 is : 160
⚠️ Cannot divide by zero! Defaulting to 1
Result after Dividing 1 is : 160
